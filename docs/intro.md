# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**! This comprehensive guide explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, focusing on humanoid robots and their control systems.

## About This Book

This book is designed for learners entering Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics with basic Python knowledge. We focus on:

- [ROS 2 as the middleware "nervous system" for humanoid robots](./module-1/chapter-1/intro.mdx)
- Communication between [AI agents and physical robot controllers](./module-1/chapter-3/intro.mdx)
- Understanding and [modifying humanoid robot descriptions with URDF](./module-1/chapter-4/intro.mdx)

## Learning Path

The content is organized into progressive modules that build upon each other:

1. **[Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)](./module-1/chapter-1/intro.mdx)** - Learn ROS 2 fundamentals including nodes, topics, and services
2. **[Creating Simple Python ROS 2 Nodes](./module-1/chapter-2/intro.mdx)** - Hands-on experience with `rclpy` and node creation
3. **[Python Agent to ROS 2 Controller Bridge](./module-1/chapter-3/intro.mdx)** - Connecting AI agents to robot controllers
4. **[Understanding and Modifying URDF](./module-1/chapter-4/intro.mdx)** - Working with robot description files

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this book, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts
- Familiarity with command-line interfaces

## How to Use This Book

- Start with [Module 1](./module-1/chapter-1/intro.mdx) if you're new to ROS 2
- Use the [Glossary](./glossary.mdx) for definitions of specialized terms
- Refer to the [Comprehensive Index](./index.mdx) to find specific topics
- Practice with the exercises in each chapter

## Success Metrics

After completing this book, you will be able to:
- Explain ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services ([Chapter 1](./module-1/chapter-1/intro.mdx))
- Write a simple Python ROS 2 node using `rclpy` ([Chapter 2](./module-1/chapter-2/intro.mdx))
- Conceptually bridge a Python AI agent to a ROS 2 controller ([Chapter 3](./module-1/chapter-3/intro.mdx))
- Interpret and modify a basic humanoid URDF ([Chapter 4](./module-1/chapter-4/intro.mdx))

## Reference Materials
