# Deployment Process Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the deployment process for the AI-Native Book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics website.

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The site is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Workflow Configuration
The deployment workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and will:
1. Run on pushes to the `main` or `master` branches
2. Install Node.js dependencies
3. Build the static site using `npm run build`
4. Deploy the built site to the `gh-pages` branch

### Deployment Process
1. **Automatic Deployment**: When changes are pushed to the main branch, the GitHub Action will automatically build and deploy the site
2. **Manual Deployment**: You can manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab if needed

### Site URL
After successful deployment, the site will be available at:
`https://<your-username>.github.io/my-book-ai/`

## Local Testing

Before deployment, test the site locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run start

# Build for production (test build process)
npm run build

# Serve the built site locally
npm run serve
```

## Configuration Settings

### Docusaurus Configuration
Key settings in `docusaurus.config.ts`:
- `url`: Base URL for the site
- `baseUrl`: Path under which the site is served (set to `/my-book-ai/` for GitHub Pages)

- `projectName`: Repository name

### GitHub Pages Settings
In your GitHub repository settings:
1. Go to "Pages" section
2. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Check for syntax errors in MDX files
2. **Broken links**: Verify all internal links are correct
3. **Missing assets**: Ensure all referenced images/files exist

### Verification Steps
1. Check that the GitHub Action completed successfully
2. Verify the site loads at the expected URL
3. Test navigation and key pages
4. Confirm search functionality works

## Updating Content
1. Make changes to the documentation files in the `docs/` directory
2. Commit and push changes to the main branch
3. Monitor the GitHub Action workflow for successful completion
4. Verify the updated content appears on the live site
