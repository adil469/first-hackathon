# Introduction to Digital Twins in Physical AI

This module explores the concept of digital twins in Physical AI, focusing on physics-based simulation environments for humanoid robots. We'll examine two primary simulation platforms: Gazebo for physics-based simulation and Unity for visualization and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

## What is a Digital Twin?

A digital twin in Physical AI is a virtual replica of a physical robot or system that simulates its behavior in real-time. This virtual model incorporates physics, sensors, and environmental interactions to mirror the real-world counterpart.

## Module Overview

In this module, you will learn:

1. **Gazebo Physics Simulation**: How to create accurate physics-based simulations with gravity, collisions, and joint dynamics
2. **Unity Visualization and HRI**: How to implement high-quality visualization and human-robot interaction interfaces
3. **Sensor Simulation**: How to simulate various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up physics-based simulations with realistic gravity and collision detection
- Integrate Unity for advanced visualization and human-robot interaction
- Simulate and validate various sensor types used in robotics
- Connect simulation environments with ROS 2 for seamless communication

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with robot modeling (URDF/XACRO)
- Basic knowledge of physics concepts (gravity, collisions, forces)
