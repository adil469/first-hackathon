# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module. This section covers the integration of LLMs with robotics for perception, planning, and action, focusing on natural language to ROS 2 action pipelines.

## Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent a significant advancement in robotics, combining:
- **Vision**: Perception and object recognition capabilities
- **Language**: Natural language understanding and processing
- **Action**: Execution of physical or logical actions

This module will help you understand how these components work together to create intelligent robotic systems that can respond to natural language commands and perform complex tasks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
1. Explain the fundamental concepts of Vision-Language-Action systems
2. Describe voice-to-action pipelines using Whisper technology
3. Translate natural language goals into ROS 2 action sequences
4. Understand end-to-end autonomous humanoid behavior

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have basic knowledge of:
- ROS 2 fundamentals
- Simulation concepts
- AI/ML basics
