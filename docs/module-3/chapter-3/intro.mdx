# Nav2: Path Planning for Humanoid Movement

Navigation2 (Nav2) is ROS 2's navigation stack that provides path planning and execution capabilities. For humanoid robots, Nav2 requires specialized considerations due to their unique locomotion characteristics.

## Humanoid-Specific Navigation Challenges

Humanoid robots present unique navigation challenges compared to wheeled or tracked platforms:

- **Stability Requirements**: Maintaining balance during movement
- **Step Planning**: Navigating terrain with discrete step locations
- **Dynamic Movement**: Managing center of mass during locomotion
- **Foot Placement**: Precise positioning of feet for stable walking

## Nav2 Components for Humanoid Navigation

The Nav2 stack includes several key components adapted for humanoid movement:

1. **Global Planner**: Creates high-level paths considering humanoid kinematics
2. **Local Planner**: Adjusts paths in real-time to avoid obstacles
3. **Controller**: Manages low-level movement commands
4. **Behavior Trees**: Coordinates complex navigation behaviors

## Path Planning Algorithms

For humanoid robots, path planning must consider:

- **Kinematic Constraints**: Joint limits and movement capabilities
- **Stability Regions**: Maintaining center of mass within support polygons
- **Step Sequences**: Planning footstep locations for stable locomotion
- **Terrain Analysis**: Evaluating surface traversability

The navigation system must also handle dynamic environments and adapt to changing conditions while maintaining the humanoid's balance and safety.

## Integration with Isaac Ecosystem

The integration of Nav2 with Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS creates a comprehensive pipeline from simulation to deployment, enabling humanoid robots to navigate complex environments with confidence.
